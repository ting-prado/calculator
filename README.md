# Calculator

## Introduction

This project is a simple design of a calculator that can operate two numbers at a time. It supports positive/negative and floating numbers.

## Goals and Objectives

- Create a basic calculator with buttons for each digit, functions, clear, and equal key
- Once the keys are clicked, the corresponding numbers will be shown at display
- Add keyboard support
- Allow decimal and negative numbers
- Add backspace button

## How it works

- There is no display within the screen when the user enters the site
- To enter numbers, the corresponding buttons should be clicked/pressed

  | Number/Function   |       Key |
  | ----------------- | --------: |
  | One               |         1 |
  | Two               |         2 |
  | Three             |         3 |
  | Four              |         4 |
  | Five              |         5 |
  | Six               |         6 |
  | Seven             |         7 |
  | Eight             |         8 |
  | Nine              |         9 |
  | Zero              |         0 |
  | Add               |         + |
  | Subtract          |         - |
  | Multiply          |        \* |
  | Divide            |    % or / |
  | Erase             | Backspace |
  | Clear All         |    C or c |
  | Positive/Negative |  Spacebar |
  | Decimal Point     |         . |

- To operate two numbers, the equal button must be clicked/pressed to get the answer.
- Previous answer can be used as operand for the next operation

## Thoughts After Completion

This project was confusing for me because there are a lot of bugs to watch out for. While trying to fix the bugs, I tried to challenge myself by finding the most efficient solutions I can think of. The solutions I have now may not be the best yet but I'll definitely fix it when I become better in the future. Overall, This project was kinda tough but I am satisfied with my finished work.
